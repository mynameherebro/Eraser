V5.6a 19-Jan-2003 Very minor upgrade - Just reinstall
    Many thanks to Steven Michael for the cool new icons. Much
    appreciated.
    DBAN is now wrapped in a winimage self extractor. This will make
    things
    easier for those who prefer GUI apps.
    To use this option:

           2. Click on the Start button and then choose Programs->
           Eraser->
           Create Boot Nuke Disk.
           3. Ensure 'Writing on Floppy' is ticked.
           Tick 'Formatting' if your floppy needs to be formatted.
           4. Click OK.
           Result: Your Boot Nuke Disk has now been created.
           5. Boot up your PC with the floppy still remaining in your a:
           drive.
           Result: All drives will now be erased.
           IMPORTANT: USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION
    Fixed a few typos in the installer
V5.6 16-Dec-2002
        1. Eraser now includes 'Darik's Boot and Nuke' disk. There is a
        new
        directory under Eraser called 'boot'.
        For a summary:
        'Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot floppy
        that
        securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will
        automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard
        disk
        that
        it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or
        emergency data destruction.'
V5.541 24-Nov-2002 (Final)
    1. Fixed issue with Verify.exe not picking up files.
    2. Fixed issue with installing to long pathnames.
       Eraser giving (null) when clicking on recycle bin was due to it
       not finding eraser in long installed pathnames.
    3. In this release all exe's including the installer.
       (except Eraserd.exe - Dos app which cannot be signed)
       and dll's have been digitally signed.
       In explorer right click and select properties.
       A tab with digital signatures will appear. It should verify as
       OK.
       If not there is a problem.
V5.54 05-Nov-2002 (*BETA*)
    1. Fixes for XP freespace erase. Note: those who found they has
    100's
       of random files left in their root dir after a crash can now
       delete them
       by
       'del eraser*.*' as they will be called e.g eraser345987f.6fd
    2. system now confirms the overwrite of your scheduler file on
    install.
V5.53 30-Aug-2002
    1. Complete rewrite of installer. Now using the Free Innosetup
       by jrsoftware.
    2. Registery entries not uninstalled by previous version now fixed.
    3. Problems with being unable to uninstall should be fixed.
V5.52 29-July-2002
    1. Fixed some dialog problems as
       per
       http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q320479
           This will need to be fixed to allow selection of files in
           hidden
           directories.
    2. (Beta) Eraser can now delete files on reboot - Under schedule
    task
       set the day to 'Reboot' This is a new feature and will be altered
       and redesigned according to feedback.
V5.51
    1. Fixed corrupted eraserd. Now tested with FreeDOS.
    2. Fixed issue where eraser was not pointing to correct registry
       entries.
V5.5 08-Dec-2002
        This version addresses all of the upgrade issues we had with
        converting to C7
        1. Installer
                After testing with the windows installer we concluded
                that
                1. There are still too many users without the windows
                installer.
                2. Installing the installer runtime is a major download.
                3. Many users did not know what to do with an .msi file
        2. Import/export/save dialogs no longer worked with C++7. Fixed
        3. EraserD was compiled with VC8 which we did not have so after
           scouring the net the digital mars compiler was found. See
           www.digitalmars.com this is a great product works with WIN32
           as
           well. I was amazed that we could recompile with little
           effort.For
           the dos version many users have asked for the ability to
           bootup
           a machine and erase it from the floppy.
           We are experimenting with creating a FAT32 boot disk using
           FreeDOS see http://www.freedos.com this would allow you to
           erase > 2gig partitions.
        4. Fixed the Delphi example
        5. Beta version of the boot erase option.
V5.4.1
    This version fixed problems with the VC7 MFC libraries and we
    created
    a new installer.
V5.4
        This is the first release since we took on maintaining eraser
        from
        Sami
        Tolvanen
        Changes: Updated to work with windows XP.
        Program now compiled with Visual C++.NET.
